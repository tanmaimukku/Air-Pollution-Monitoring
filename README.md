# Air Pollution Monitoring Project

## About the Project
This project, titled "Improving Spatio-Temporal Understanding of Particulate Matter using Low-Cost IoT Sensors," focuses on the deployment of low-cost Internet of Things (IoT) sensor nodes for monitoring particulate matter (PM) in urban environments. Our objective is to enhance the spatial and temporal resolution of air pollution data, which is crucial for making informed decisions on air quality management.

## Features
- **Dense Deployment**: Utilizes multiple sensor nodes to capture detailed spatial variations in particulate matter.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: A web-based dashboard displays real-time data on particulate matter concentrations.
- **Data Analysis**: Performs correlation analysis and spatial interpolation to understand the dynamics of air pollution.

## Project Components
1. **Sensor Node Implementation**:
   - **NodeMCU Microcontroller**: Manages sensor data sampling and transmission.
   - **PM Sensors**: Measures particulate matter sizes PM2.5 and PM10.
   - **Temperature and Humidity Sensors**: Assists in adjusting PM readings based on environmental conditions.
